There are two sample datasets.

expression-Stage1.RData: Gene expression expression for breast cancer at stage I, where 
                         rows are samples and columns are genes  
  

Test.RData: networks  for DrNMF with n*n*5, where n=1500 and networks[,,1:4] corresponds 
            to the gene co-expression network from stage I to IV, and networks[,,5] is the 
            protein interaction networks. The symbols of genes are listed in genename.
